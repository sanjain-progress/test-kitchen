We're going to call our new suite `server` by editing `kitchen.yml` in your editor of choice so that it looks similar to:

~~~
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_infra

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-20.04
  - name: centos-8

suites:
  - name: default
    verifier:
      inspec_tests:
        - test/integration/default
  - name: server
    named_run_list: server
    verifier:
      inspec_tests:
        - test/integration/server
~~~

Now run `kitchen list` to see our new suite in action:

~~~
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action    Last Error
default-ubuntu-2004  Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
default-centos-8     Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
server-ubuntu-2004   Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
server-centos-8      Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
~~~

Woah, we've doubled our number of instances! Yes, that is going to happen. This explosion of test cases is just one reason why testing is hard.
